#FoodCal

Demo: http://foodcal.meteor.com

FoodCal is a simple (and I DO mean simple) SPA built in Meteor.js in about an hour and a half.

It's my first project in Meteor and I was surprised at just how simple it really was to make.

It came from seeing my wife sit and sketch out meal plans for the week. I thought it would be easier if she could just write out the meals she had planned then randomize the order to come up with a unique schedule each week.

#Future Improvements

* Add dates
* Keep meals with the same primary ingredients more than 1 day apart
* Add more primary ingredients
* Move separate concerns into separate files
